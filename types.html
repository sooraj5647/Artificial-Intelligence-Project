<P>AI technologies are categorized by their capacity to mimic human characteristics, the technology they use to do this and their real – world applications. </P>
<P><B><U>AI is generally divided into three types :</U></B></P>
<P>1. Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI)<BR>2. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) <BR>3. Artificial superintelligence (ASI)</P>
<P><U><B>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) / Weak AI / Narrow AI</B></U></P>
<P>Narrow AI is goal-oriented, designed to perform singular tasks or it is s focused on one narrow task. - i.e. facial recognition, speech recognition/voice assistants, driving a car, or searching the internet - and is very intelligent at completing the specific task it is programmed to do.It is widely used for NLP.</P>
<P><B>Examples of narrow AI:</B><BR>Google Search<BR>Siri by Apple, Alexa by Amazon, Cortana by Microsoft and other virtual assistants<BR>IBM's Watson<BR>Image / facial recognition software<BR>Email spam filters <BR>Self-driving cars<BR>Google Translate</P>
<P><B><U>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) / Strong AI / Deep AI</U></B></P>
<P>AGI is the concept of a machine with general intelligence that mimics human intelligence and/or behaviors, with the ability to learn and apply its intelligence to solve any problem. AGI can think, understand, and act in a way that is indistinguishable from that of a human in any given situation.<BR>It is defined as a machine with the ability to apply intelligence to any problem, rather than just one specific problem.<BR>Strong AI does not exist. Experts predict it may be developed by 2030 or 2045.</P>
