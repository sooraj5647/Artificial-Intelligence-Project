<P><BR>Decision making is a crucial part of intelligence.</P>
<P><U><B>Example:</B></U></P>
<P>1. If someone starts talking to us, we know how to keep the conversation going. We can understand what people mean and can reply in the same way. <BR>2. When we are hungry, we can come up with various options on what to eat depending upon the food we have at our homes. <BR>3. When we read something, we are able to understand its meaning and answer anything regarding it. </P>
<P><U><B>How do you make decisions?</B></U></P>
<P>The basis of decision making depends upon the availability of information and how we experience and understand it. <BR>      ‘Information’ includes our past experience, intuition, knowledge, and self-awareness. <BR>We can’t make “good” decisions without information because then we have to deal with unknown factors and face uncertainty, which leads us to make wild guesses, flipping coins, or rolling a dice. <BR>Having knowledge, experience, or insights given a certain situation, helps us visualize what the outcomes could be. and how we can achieve/avoid those outcomes. </P>
