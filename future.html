<P><BR>The future is really UNKNOWN.<BR>Researchers seem to disagree on a lot of the same issues.<BR>With the rate at which technology is improving it is logical to believe AI will continue to get more and more sophisticated.<BR>But we can imagine two different kind of future of A.I.  They are :</P>
<P>1. Positive<BR>2. Negative</P>
<P><B><U>Positive imagination of the Future:</U></B></P>
<P>Maybe, the day is not far when we will just  sit back in our cozy little beds and just  command our personal Robot's to entirely  do our ruts . He will be a perfect  companion for us. Just enjoy the  Technology.</P>
<P><B><U>Negative imagination of the Future:</U></B></P>
<P>It may end in other way too. Some day there will be a knock at our door. As we open it, we’ll  see a large number of Robots marching into our house destroying everything we own and  looting you. This is because ever since there is  an advantage in the Technology, it attracts anti - social elements. This is true for Robots too.</P>
<P>Because now they will have full power to think as human, even as of anti-social lements. So  we should think trice before giving them power of Cognition.</P>
