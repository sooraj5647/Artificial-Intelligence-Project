<P><BR>Natural Language Processing, usually shortened as NLP, is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using the natural language. </P>
<P>The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable.</P>
<P>A typical interaction between humans and machines using Natural Language Processing could go as follows:</P>
<P>1. A human talks to the machine<BR>2. The machine captures the audio<BR>3. Audio to text conversion takes place<BR>4. Processing of the text’s data<BR>5. Data to audio conversion takes place<BR>6. The machine responds to the human by playing the audio file</P>
<P><BR><B><U>Examples of NLP:</U></B></P>
<P>1. Language translation applications such as Google Translate<BR>2.  Word Processors such as Microsoft Word and Grammarly that employ NLP to check grammatical accuracy of texts.<BR>3. Interactive Voice Response (IVR) applications used in call centers to respond to certain users’ requests.<BR>4. Personal assistant applications such as OK Google, Siri, Cortana, and Alexa.</P>
<P>5.<U>Google assistant:</U><BR>a) Sensors capture your speech as input.<BR>b) Identify the words.<BR>c) For example you say,"I want Pizza."<BR>d) Here 'Pizza' is marked as being food.<BR>e) Threre is no term as 'recipe' that indicates  - speaker is not asking how to make pizza.<BR>f) Thus system concludes that speaker is looking for a restaurant that serves 'Pizza'.<BR>g) These transitions from sounds to words gives an idea about the user's need which helps the system to fetch required information.<BR>h) System grabs GPs info, looks up restaurants and ranks them by distance, rating or price.<BR>i) Or if you have a history, it might suggest a place that you already like or frequently visit.</P>
<P>6.<U>Email filters:</U><BR>Email filters are one of the most basic and initial applications of NLP online. It started out with spam filters, uncovering certain words or phrases that signal a spam message.</P>
<P>7.<U>Mystery Animal: </U><BR>A game based on Natural Language Processing where the participant has to guess the animal by asking maximum 20 questions to AI. The animal randomly gets selected for each game by AI and the machine replies in either yes or no. </P>
<P><B><U>Speech Recognition:</U></B></P>
<P>The primary interactive method of  communication used by humans is not reading and writing, it is speech. The goal of  speech recognition research is to allow  computers to understand human speech. So  that they can hear our voices and recognize  the words we are speaking. It simplifies the  process of interactive communication  between people and computers, thus it  advances the goal of NLP.</P>
